# MyTecsys – Company Website with Authentication (MERN Stack)

MyTecsys is a full-stack company website built using the MERN stack, featuring a professional landing page, user authentication (login & registration), and database integration using MongoDB Atlas.

The project represents a real-world corporate website structure, combining frontend UI, backend authentication, and database connectivity in a single application.
